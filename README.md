## Restful Routes and CRUD Actions

REST => Representation State Transfer => set of conventions for structuring our ROUTES and mapping them to CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

  | METHOD | ROUTE | CONTROLLER ACTION   | Description |
| ------------- |-------------| ----------- | ------------------- |
| GET  |  /tasks | #index | Show all tasks | 
| POST | /tasks | #create | Create a new task|
| GET  | /tasks/new | #new | Render form for creating a new task |
| GET  | /tasks/:id/edit | #edit | Render form for editing a task  |
| GET  | /tasks/:id | #show | Show a single task |
| PATCH | /tasks/:id | #update | Update a task |
| DELETE | /tasks/:id | #destroy | DELETE a task |
