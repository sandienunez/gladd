<h3>Your list is ordered from Highest to Lowest Priority below. </h3>

<p> 2 = Lowest Priority (Task should be done this week if possible, not as pressing)</p>
<p> 3 = Lowest Priority (Task will be completed in the next 2 days, pretty important)</p>
<p> 4 = Lowest Priority (Task needs to be finished by tomorrow, very important)</p>
<p> 5 = Highest Priority (Task needs to be completed today BUT can wait until later today, extra important)</p>
